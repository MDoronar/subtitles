1
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:12,672
This is it? Ijust... sign this and it's done?

2
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:16,472
As soon as I file it with the city clerk.

3
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,751
This pen. She gave it to me.

4
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:26,154
It was an anniversary present.

5
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:24,874
I don't remember which one.

6
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:29,033
Walter, they are expecting the documents...

7
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:28,875
..by the end of business - ten minutes ago.

8
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:32,551
- I know what time it is.
- Then you should sign.

9
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:36,997
- What are you doing, Walter?
- After 17 years, they can wait another day.

10
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:44,519
Listen, no one knows better than I
what an emotional experience this is.

11
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,148
Don't lawyer me, Jane.

12
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:50,358
- I'll do it tomorrow.
- Why go through another day of this?

13
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,590
I said tomorrow.

14
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:13,435
Excuse me.
Are you holding this for someone?

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,275
It's the only open seat.

16
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,715
Go ahead.

17
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:03,873
Good evening. What can I get you?

18
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:58,110
Tonic water with lime, please.

19
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:00,634
Sir, would you like another one?

20
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:04,030
Sure.

21
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:07,550
Thanks.

22
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:04,358
For what? Ordering another drink?

23
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:10,150
There's a man behind me wearing a red tie.

24
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:16,835
For some reason, he felt compelled
to tell me half his life story.

25
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:32,752
I was afraid if you got up,
he might try to get in the other half.

26
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:20,273
I guess some people think that you owe
'em something just cos you're out alone.

27
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,955
Does that ever bother you?

28
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,951
What?

29
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:46,110
Being alone.

30
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,590
(distorted cries)

31
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,712
OK.

32
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,274
Excuse me, sir.

33
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,430
Excuse me. Thank you.

34
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:55,638
- I'm looking for Detective Waltos.
- Who's asking?

35
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,830
I work with Assistant Director Skinner.
I'd like to speak with him.

36
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,356
After he gives his statement.
We'll finish at the station house.

37
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:03,996
- Why don't you just get a statement here?
- He's suffering from a minor memory lapse.

38
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,630
(phone rings)

39
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,791
- Yeah.
- I just got your message.

40
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:12,471
- You said Skinner called in a homicide?
- It's a little more complicated than that.

41
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:18,516
- It seems like he had a front-row seat.
- I don't understand.

42
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:20,798
I don't understand it either.
They're not letting me talk to him. Hold on.

43
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,710
Excuse me, sir?

44
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:28,155
I appreciate your concern, but there's
no need for you to get involved in this.

45
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,390
Detective. Detective.

46
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:31,078
Detective. Can you at least tell me what
happened? What does he say happened?

47
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,389
He claims he met the victim in the bar.

48
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:46,074
After a couple of drinks,
they decided to get a room.

49
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:51,874
All fine, except when he wakes up, he finds
her lying next to him with a broken neck.

50
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,872
- That's all he says he remembers.
- You don't believe him?

51
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:12,192
He refused to take a polygraph test.
It's not helping his credibility.

52
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:13,832
- Has the victim been identified?
- She had no purse, nothing with a name on.

53
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,075
There must be evidence of an intruder.

54
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,833
Agent Mulder, I've been on the job 18 years.

55
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:24,118
- I know the drill.
- You should be canvassing employees...

56
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:29,992
I appreciate that he's your colleague,
but I want you to understand somethin'.

57
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,356
He's also a suspect.

58
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:36,192
Detective, when you're
done questioning him,...

59
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:36,235
..I'd appreciate a call.

60
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,550
All right.

61
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:43,870
- Did you get any of that?
- Most of it. Mulder, I'm on my way.

62
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,273
No, I want you to take a look at that body.

63
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:45,152
Get down to the coroner's.
I'll meet you there.

64
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:00,196
The conspicuous absence of any contusions
or lacerations would strongly suggest...

65
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:53,954
..that the victim's injuries
were sustained without a struggle.

66
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:58,796
I would have to concur with
the county coroner's report...

67
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:01,953
..that her murder was probably a sudden
and violent act in a vulnerable moment.

68
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:08,514
Beyond this, I've found nothing
to recommend further investigation.

69
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:11,353
- Beyond what?
- Her spinal cord was crushed.

70
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:16,068
The cervical vertebrae was fractured
in what appears to be manual trauma.

71
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:19,029
Were Skinner's the only prints on the body?

72
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,317
So far. They found no semen samples.

73
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:26,431
There was some irritation,
probably an allergic reaction to latex.

74
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:32,555
At least they were having safe sex.

75
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:37,270
- Have they learned anything more?
- Yeah. Her name was Carina Sayles.

76
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:39,315
She was a legal secretary for
a criminal defence firm here in town.

77
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:45,077
- Have you talked to anybody there?
- One of the partners.

78
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:47,396
She was fired a few weeks ago
over an indiscretion.

79
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:52,072
- An indiscretion?
- She was doing some moonlighting.

80
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:54,154
- A little work for one of the firm's clients.
- What kind of work?

81
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,437
This client operated an escort service.

82
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:57,914
She was a prostitute.

83
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:03,670
- Gimme five minutes here.
- I'll get the car.

84
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:05,278
Addendum. Observed what appears
to be a residual phosphorescence...

85
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:12,519
..around the victim's mouth and nose.

86
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,757
Note to have this analysed.

87
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:19,115
- Yes?
- Lorraine Kelleher?

88
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:23,751
- She's busy right now. Can I help you?
- Busy or not, we need to speak with her.

89
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,709
I'll tell her you're here.

90
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,356
Lorraine.

91
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:36,075
- Business must be booming.
- I think you mean banging.

92
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:34,596
Whatever this is about, can we do it later?
I'm running late for an appointment.

93
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:43,319
We'd like to ask you some questions
about an employee of yours: Carina Sayles.

94
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:44,794
She does work for you, doesn't she?

95
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,230
I'm ten minutes late for a meeting with her.

96
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,237
I don't think she's gonna make
that meeting.

97
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:51,354
- Oh? Why not?
- She's dead.

98
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:51,948
She was murdered last night.

99
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:55,911
- How?
- That's what we're still trying to determine.

100
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,350
I, um...

101
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,709
- I don't know what to say.
- Tell us if she was working last night.

102
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:04,756
- If she was, who paid for her company?
- I'm afraid I can't do that.

103
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:32,951
- I guess that would hurt future book sales.
- You'd be surprised who some clients are.

104
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:40,471
- I don't think I would be.
- I doubt they'd wanna get entangled...

105
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:43,114
- ..in a homicide investigation.
- We just need one name from you.

106
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,795
Who hired Carina Sayles?

107
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:51,873
Let's just say you both work
for the government. And so do I.

108
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:55,559
Cut the crap. Who hired her?

109
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:55,239
She called me last night.

110
00:08:55,320 --> 00:09:01,395
She said that she'd met someone in a bar
who was interested in a transaction.

111
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:06,634
- I took his credit card.
- Then you have his name.

112
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,549
Walter Skinner.

113
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,950
Thank you.

114
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:21,394
- What the hell was he thinkin'?
- It just doesn't seem like him.

115
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,472
You'd think he'd be a little more discreet.

116
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:13,791
The lack of discretion is the least of his sins.

117
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:17,196
Still not enough to prove anything.

118
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,595
No, but that doesn't mean
that we can discount the evidence.

119
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:27,349
- You really believe Skinner did this?
- I feel the same way as you do,...

120
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,115
..but we were shown a dated record
with his credit card number on it.

121
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:37,153
- Credit card fraud happens every day.
- He was with her at the time of her death.

122
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:42,197
He's offered us no explanation or alibi.

123
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,637
Truth is, we don't know
very much about him.

124
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:47,628
What he does off duty, who he really is...

125
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,790
We know that he's put his ass
on the line for us a number of times.

126
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,231
We owe it to him to find out what happened.

127
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,993
Even if it means proving his guilt?

128
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,150
(phone rings)

129
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:04,750
Yeah. Mulder.

130
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,672
- Thank you.
- Who was that?

131
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:05,956
Detective Waltos. Skinner's been
released on his own recognizance.

132
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:21,436
- Sir. Sir.
- This doesn't concern either of you.

133
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:16,117
- Of course it concerns us.
- Why won't you tell us what happened, sir?

134
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:20,992
Read the police report
if you're really that curious.

135
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:24,436
Does it explain why you refused
to take a polygraph test?

136
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:28,191
Or why there's a prostitute in the morgue
with your fingerprints all over her?

137
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:37,876
You didn't know she was
a prostitute, did you?

138
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:38,191
(driver) What are you doin', you jerk?

139
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,751
Walter.

140
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:04,515
I just heard what happened.
I was coming to see you.

141
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,675
Walter!

142
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:38,990
Do you know him?

143
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:34,190
I used to think so.

144
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,959
I'm Sharon Skinner. I'm his wife.

145
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,600
We were just a little caught off guard.

146
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:14,112
Neither of us even knew that
he was married. He never told us.

147
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:16,949
One of the things Walter has always
been good at is keeping secrets.

148
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,713
We haven't been together
for almost eight months.

149
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:24,232
Has he always been such a private person?

150
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:29,312
It's more than that. He lives under this
misguided notion that silence is strength.

151
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:35,599
He's built a wall to keep everyone out.

152
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:33,312
- Including you?
- Especially me.

153
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:37,074
Is that why you were separated?

154
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:40,276
Yeah, I just realised one day
that we were no longer married.

155
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,920
We'd become roommates instead.

156
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:44,472
We were paying the bills,
taking out the garbage...

157
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:48,358
- And I couldn't live like that any more.
- (phone rings)

158
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,310
'Scuse me.

159
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,316
Scully.

160
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:18,439
You were one of the few people
that Walter ever mentioned from work.

161
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:30,549
Not that he said much. But, from the way
he talked, I could tell he respected you.

162
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:38,396
That's probably why I feel that I can ask you.

163
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:40,914
- Ask me what?
- If Walter really killed that woman.

164
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,994
Sorry. Mulder, we've gotta go.

165
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:48,511
You've got our numbers
if you need to reach us.

166
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:51,472
You still haven't answered my question.

167
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:54,154
No. I don't think he did it.

168
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:09,474
What's going on here?

169
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:59,073
- Agents Mulder and Scully?
- That's right.

170
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,230
I'm Special Agent Bonnecaze.

171
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:12,113
I've been called up from the Norfolk
field office to coordinate this inquiry.

172
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:17,589
Well, last time I checked,
rifling through a man's office...

173
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,549
..was considered an invasion of privacy.

174
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:24,588
We're operating under guidelines specified
by the Office of Professional Conduct.

175
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:28,433
- A protocol you've opted to disregard.
- What do you mean?

176
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:29,993
I want you to make
yourselves available tomorrow.

177
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:32,280
Available for what?

178
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:34,715
A formal hearing
regarding AD Skinner's case.

179
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:37,072
What case?
He hasn't even been charged yet.

180
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:42,073
The hearing is to assess and determine
his ability to continue as assistant director.

181
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:49,511
In the meantime we're appointing our own
investigators to pursue any criminal case.

182
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:53,035
I must ask you to stop looking into this.

183
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:54,431
In case we turn up evidence
that might support his innocence?

184
00:15:55,760 --> 00:16:00,675
Any evidence you may have obtained,
you'll be presenting tomorrow afternoon.

185
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:05,674
At the hearing.

186
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:03,111
(ringing tone)

187
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:08,633
Skinner's not answering his phone.

188
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:13,156
- He's doing everything he shouldn't be.
- Why? He knows better than that.

189
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:21,112
The evidence is still circumstantial at best.

190
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,753
He's behaving like a guilty man, Mulder.

191
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:30,038
The man's marriage is breaking up.
He's stressed out.

192
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:38,396
It's his irrational behaviour
that concerns me.

193
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:45,519
It speaks to a state of mind.
If an otherwise stable man is compelled...

194
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,591
..to go out and hire a prostitute,
what else is he capable of?

195
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:56,474
Please. Give him the benefit of the doubt.

196
00:16:56,920 --> 00:17:00,913
I am, Mulder. Believe me.
I'm not trying to convince myself.

197
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:11,030
When I mentioned that hooker to him,
he didn't even seem to know.

198
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:17,549
- Maybe he doesn't remember.
- Either he remembers or he's a liar.

199
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,711
Not necessarily.

200
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:32,678
(Scully) This man's
running away from a train.

201
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:40,796
He sees it coming straight at him.
He hears its whistle.

202
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:47,314
Several times a month
he ran away from that train.

203
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:56,756
Until one night he broke his wife's arm
when he threw her to the floor.

204
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,879
- Night terrors?
- No. Night terrors and sleepwalking...

205
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,954
..occur during slow-wave non-dream sleep.

206
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:40,357
The clinical term is
REM sleep behaviour disorder.

207
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,878
Though rare, dozens of cases
of sleep-related violence

208
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,353
have been attributed to it.

209
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:46,794
But what does it have to do with Skinner?

210
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:50,196
This video came from the
Bethesda Sleep Disorder Centre,...

211
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:55,516
..where Skinner has been receiving
treatment for three months.

212
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,316
For running away from trains?

213
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:59,280
Same disorder, different dreams.

214
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:02,673
According to Skinner's psychiatrist,
he's been experiencing a dream...

215
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,914
..in which he's confronted by an old woman.

216
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:08,795
She speaks, but he doesn't understand.

217
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:12,674
Sometimes she straddles his chest,
suffocating him.

218
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:14,752
So you think Skinner may have
killed the victim in his sleep.

219
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:25,150
A lot of patients have
no recollection of their activities,...

220
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:30,592
..which might explain Skinner's amnesia.

221
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:36,200
- It's not such a strange story.
- It isn't?

222
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:44,196
lt's ancient, actually. You may have heard it.
Although not in such clinical terms.

223
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:01,279
In the Middle Ages
a visitation like Skinner's...

224
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:17,836
..would have been attributed to a succubus.

225
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:31,792
It's a spirit that visits men in the night,
usually in the form of an old woman.

226
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:38,316
- Visits them for sex?
- Usually. But sometimes the succubus...

227
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:43,636
..becomes so attached to the man that she'd
kill any woman competing for his affection.

228
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,388
What's that?

229
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:46,511
Luminous phenomena have been associated
with some succubus encounters,...

230
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:50,715
- ..according to the mythology. Why?
- I feel strange saying this,...

231
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:55,512
..but I found something during my
postmortem exam I think you should see.

232
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:09,469
There's a circular patch around the mouth
and nose, approximately 11cm in diameter.

233
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:21,229
It retained light energy.
It glowed in the dark.

234
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:21,193
I know what I saw, Mulder. It was here.

235
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:26,158
This phosphorescence required
no UV or infrared light?

236
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:30,990
No. It was definitely visible
to the naked eye.

237
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:34,230
- Did you get a sample?
- Yeah. I sent one over to Chem Tox.

238
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:37,549
- And?
- My hunch was that it was fungal growth,...

239
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:46,474
..but the only substance that they detected
was amylase, which is found in saliva.

240
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:56,958
So I had them send over a sample
to the elemental analysis unit.

241
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:00,156
The results should be back...

242
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,352
This is Agent Scully.

243
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:07,310
I'm calling to find out the lab results on
a tissue sample that I sent in this morning.

244
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,829
- Thank you.
- What did they say?

245
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:11,596
That there was no analysable substance
in the sample container.

246
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:22,838
- Are you sure you saw something?
- This isn't exactly something I'd make up.

247
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,999
Maybe that's it.

248
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:26,680
Maybe that's why Skinner's running.

249
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:33,948
- He's afraid.
- That he did it?

250
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:37,033
That he doesn't know he didn't do it.

251
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:04,476
(knocking)

252
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:15,750
Hi.

253
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,395
You didn't answer your phone.

254
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:03,433
I unplugged it. I haven't been
sleeping too well lately.

255
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:12,877
So, are you going to invite me in
or should I start building an ark?

256
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,870
Come in.

257
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:27,910
You still haven't gotten around
to unpacking.

258
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:26,158
Yeah, well, you know... Work.

259
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:26,748
So what are you doing here, Sharon?

260
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:35,750
I'm not sure. After I saw you today,
I didn't know what else to do.

261
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:46,954
If you want to satisfy
some morbid curiosity...

262
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:26,798
That's not why I came. I just...
I just wanna make sure you're OK.

263
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:38,079
I'm OK. Except right now,
company's about the last thing that I need.

264
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:40,079
- I'm not company. I'm your wife.
- Ex-wife. You asked for the divorce.

265
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:40,399
Only because you didn't have the guts
to ask for one yourself,

266
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:42,831
so don't put it on me.

267
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,870
Fair enough.

268
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:49,315
So what else do you want me to say?

269
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:50,910
Nothing.

270
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:54,114
I don't want you to say anything.

271
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:58,754
I just want you to let me in.
Just this one time.

272
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:54,796
Why?

273
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,996
Because I know you.

274
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:02,759
I know that you're scared
and that you could use some comfort.

275
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:19,669
I also know that you'll never
let me give it to you.

276
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,468
Just take care of yourself, OK?

277
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:08,076
(thunder and rain)

278
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:21,390
(screaming)

279
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:23,390
(banging)

280
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:33,316
- What's this about?
- Wanna grab your coat and come with us?

281
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:30,837
- We'd like to ask you a few questions.
- What's going on?

282
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:33,673
It's your wife. She's been in an accident.

283
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,833
- Is she all right?
- Someone ran her off the road.

284
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:40,589
You're gonna have to come with us.

285
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:50,556
We'll also need to see
the keys to your car, sir.

286
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:52,710
- How is she?
- The CT scan shows a subdural haematoma.

287
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:00,269
She's in surgery right now
to relieve pressure on her brain.

288
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:05,309
- Scully's trying to get more information.
- I have to see her.

289
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:18,554
- You can't do that, sir.
- Why not? They said I wasn't being charged.

290
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:29,515
Not yet - but they're building
a pretty convincing case.

291
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:35,795
- You think I did this to Sharon?
- I don't, but I'm in the minority.

292
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:17,509
What about Agent Scully?

293
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:19,872
Scully...

294
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:21,791
(clears throat)

295
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:21,270
She doesn't understand why
you're not trying to defend yourself.

296
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,639
Defend myself against what?

297
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:39,717
Don't you think if I knew what was
happening to me that I would try to...

298
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:52,873
I don't know what to believe any more.

299
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:46,593
What about the old woman in your dream?

300
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,550
Who is she?

301
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:51,949
It's gonna come out.

302
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:58,035
Look, if you don't start trusting someone,
you don't stand a chance.

303
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:09,156
A few months ago I started...
seeing her again.

304
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:15,950
Again?

305
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:29,556
I told you once what...
what happened to me in Vietnam.

306
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:39,750
- That I was caught in an ambush.
- Yeah, you were the sole survivor.

307
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:44,910
You also described what sounded like
a near-death experience.

308
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:48,356
There was nothing near about it,
Agent Mulder.

309
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:52,399
- I was a dead man.
- That's when you first saw her?

310
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,912
I saw lots of things over there.

311
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:56,668
- I didn't give much credence to any of 'em.
- Why not?

312
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:06,593
I got through that experience
like most 18-year-olds.

313
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:11,031
By numbing myself with whatever
was around. l was no choirboy. l...

314
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:11,991
I inhaled.

315
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:10,757
So you just dismissed her
as another hallucination?

316
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:13,388
-I tried.
- But you couldn't?

317
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,956
She was there with me.

318
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:21,029
Watching me...

319
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:22,111
..as I was watching myself dying, my blood
spilling from a hundred different places.

320
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:29,071
Until she lifted me up and carried me back.

321
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:34,598
- Away from the light.
- Well, maybe she was trying to protect you.

322
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:37,112
Maybe she's trying to protect you now.

323
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,715
Protect me from what?

324
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:39,512
That's a question only you can answer.

325
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:41,836
I don't know.

326
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:46,868
I don't have a clue.

327
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:47,512
- Number five.
- This is Skinner's car?

328
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:04,595
According to Waltos,
the hood was still warm

329
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:18,755
when they got to Skinner's apartment.

330
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:30,756
Look at the left front panel. They match the
paint in the dent of Sharon Skinner's car.

331
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:36,518
Waltos's people finished
going over the interior?

332
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:35,879
The only prints they found were Skinner's.

333
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:39,157
- Can I borrow your flashlight?
- Sure. Why?

334
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:49,037
I don't know what you're expecting to find,
but Skinner's hearing is in half an hour.

335
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:54,949
- I'll meet you there.
- What are you doing?

336
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:52,715
Collecting evidence.

337
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:59,349
- Know how an air bag works?
- You hit something, a bag fills with air,...

338
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:01,229
- ..you don't die.
- Not air. Nitrogen.

339
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:00,554
The latent image,
the one we're interested in,

340
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:03,029
is found in the by-product
of that explosion,...

341
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:07,753
..in the finely dispersed sodium metal
that coats the interior of the air bag.

342
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:10,999
This pattern

343
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:14,476
was created by whoever was behind
the wheel when the air bag deployed.

344
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:24,237
- It doesn't look like a face.
- Not yet. First I'm scanning the pattern.

345
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:30,516
Then I run it through software
which translates its densities...

346
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:29,148
..into a dimensionalised likeness.

347
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:32,158
After that, it's a matter of fine-tuning.

348
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:37,631
- How long does that fine-tuning take?
- You need this in a hurry, it sounds like.

349
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:43,675
I'm not the only one who needs it.

350
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:50,636
(Bonnecaze) We're still
waiting for Agent Mulder?

351
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:48,069
Yes, sir.

352
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:51,869
We're finished waiting.
We're going to begin without him.

353
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:53,156
Have a seat.

354
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:04,438
Let's go over the physical evidence again.

355
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:01,072
You say you found nothing damning?

356
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:04,472
No, sir. None of the physical
evidence we recovered...

357
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:06,710
..directly connects
the assistant director to her death.

358
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:14,475
You re-examined the victim's body.
Did you find anything of note?

359
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:16,715
I took a sample of an extraneous substance
that turned out to be unidentifiable.

360
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:20,837
How's that?

361
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:24,356
A naturally occurring enzyme
around her mouth and nose.

362
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:25,109
And do you have any idea why it was there?

363
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:26,275
No.

364
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:28,828
If you are withholding something...

365
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:33,516
Sir, I feel reluctant to say,
or to speak for Agent Mulder.

366
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:33,274
To say what?

367
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:38,593
Agent Mulder had a theory
that the substance

368
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:39,159
could have come from a visitation.

369
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:42,038
But you have another explanation.

370
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:42,349
No. I'm sorry, I don't.

371
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:45,950
Do you believe in
paranormal phenomena, Agent Scully?

372
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:46,318
Whatever extreme cases
I have encountered,

373
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:48,675
I have viewed through the lens of science.

374
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:54,035
I believe that is why I was assigned
to the X-Files and to Agent Mulder.

375
00:32:55,720 --> 00:33:00,350
And has AD Skinner always been
as discriminating as you?

376
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:04,076
- Excuse me, sir? I don't understand.
- Would you say that, like yourself,...

377
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:11,279
..your direct superior has been affected by
or enchanted by Agent Mulder's notions?

378
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:21,679
No, sir. Not at all.

379
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:26,271
And yet he continues to sign off
on whatever extreme cases...

380
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:29,196
..you and Agent Mulder elect to investigate.

381
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:49,558
I believe the assistant director has
protected us out of a respect for the work.

382
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:55,234
Just as you might protect him...

383
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:55,355
..by trumping up unidentifiable evidence?

384
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:57,794
No. That is not true.

385
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:59,758
- Thank you. That will be all.
- Sir, if I may...

386
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,156
- That will be all.
- I'm not finished.

387
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:04,992
Yes, you are, Agent Scully.

388
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:06,518
- Hello?
- Mulder.

389
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:08,949
Hello.

390
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:11,873
You missed it. Not that
it would have made a difference.

391
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:16,553
- What happened? Where's Skinner?
- Out of a job.

392
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:45,079
- They dismissed him?
- He didn't have a chance.

393
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:49,395
They used us. They used the X-Files.

394
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:52,040
- How'd you know?
- Skinner's been outmanoeuvred.

395
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:52,076
They found a weakness and are exploiting it.

396
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:56,190
- Why?
- To put us in check.

397
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:58,589
You remove Skinner and you weaken us.

398
00:34:57,080 --> 00:35:00,072
- What am I looking at?
- The man that stole Skinner's car...

399
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:02,469
..and tried to kill his wife.

400
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:09,273
I don't understand. Why orchestrate
such an elaborate scheme to set him up?

401
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:15,716
- Why not kill him?
- They tried that.

402
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:17,993
A second attempt would be too obvious,
even for these thugs.

403
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:23,112
Skinner's probably worth more to them
alive and disgraced than dead and buried.

404
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:31,919
- Who is this guy?
- Danny couldn't find anything on him.

405
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:31,635
- So how do we find him?
- This guy is a pawn.

406
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:34,358
- Pawns always make the first move.
- So he must have hired the prostitute.

407
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:47,393
- What happened here?
- Jumper. Happens whenever it rains.

408
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:54,075
He got to her first.

409
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:45,758
Mulder, look.

410
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:43,472
Usually there'd be something
set up in the room.

411
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:46,589
To get pictures, tape, whatever.

412
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:48,591
Judy, we need you to identify somebody.

413
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:51,630
Is this the man who hired Carina?

414
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:58,720
- He said that nobody would get hurt.
- He lied.

415
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:58,112
Skinner's not the only person he set up.

416
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:04,350
- Are you saying he killed Carina?
- And Lorraine. He's cleaning house.

417
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:06,195
We need you to arrange a meeting.

418
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:08,910
I can't. Lorraine's the only one
who ever really talked to him.

419
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:13,238
Unfortunately Lorraine can't
get to the phone right now.

420
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,709
- Please don't make me do this.
- Look what he did to your friends.

421
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:17,557
We're your only chance
of coming out of this OK.

422
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:23,078
Mulder's right. I'll stay with you,
if you want, until we take him into custody.

423
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:28,634
I want you to call him.

424
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:31,598
Tell him you're scared
because we questioned you.

425
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:30,188
Tell him you want money to get out of town.

426
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:32,038
You'll meet him
at the Ambassador Hotel bar.

427
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:36,670
OK?

428
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:47,873
(Judy) Hello?

429
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:50,270
Hi.

430
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:56,196
This is Judy Fairly. You may not
remember me, but I work for Lorraine.

431
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:53,396
One moment, please.

432
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:49,115
Yes?

433
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:54,309
Some FBI agents came to see me
about what happened to Lorraine.

434
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:57,073
- What did you tell them?
- Nothing.

435
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:01,515
I didn't say anything.

436
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:06,353
But they scared the hell out of me.

437
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:05,235
Look... I need some money.

438
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:03,551
- That can be arranged.
- Can you meet me?

439
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:07,952
- Where would you like to meet?
- The Ambassador Hotel at...

440
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:17,509
- In an hour?
- I'm close. I'll see you in an hour.

441
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:44,751
I had to tell you, Sharon,
before anything else happens.

442
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:19,314
I'm not signing those papers.

443
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:24,516
For a lot of reasons, most of them I'm just...

444
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:23,512
..realising myself for the first time.

445
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:34,074
Some of the things I've seen.

446
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:29,158
The violence and the lies that
I've witnessed men inflict on one another -

447
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:30,148
I could never tell you that.

448
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:34,589
Not that I ever stopped believing
in the work.

449
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:37,795
But there were contradictions
that I couldn't reconcile,...

450
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:40,039
..which meant shutting down
part of myself just to do my job.

451
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:47,717
I never told you what I should have told you.

452
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:57,319
That what really got me
through each day was...

453
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:14,313
..knowing that I'd be sleeping
next to you that night.

454
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:15,114
Knowing that I had a reason
to wake up in the morning.

455
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:32,712
I'm not sure if you can even hear me now,...

456
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:26,234
..or if it even makes
a difference to you any more.

457
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:26,513
But I at least wanted you to know that.

458
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:42,035
- Sharon?
- (beeping)

459
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:51,029
Somebody!

460
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:24,874
Listen to me.

461
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:01,476
(phone rings)

462
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:35,597
- Did you get him?
- No. He hasn't shown up yet.

463
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:39,952
- He should have been here 15 minutes ago.
- What's goin' on?

464
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:41,515
Nothing.

465
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:43,750
Great.

466
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:48,072
- Maybe it's the rain.
- He isn't about to let a little rain stop him.

467
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:13,356
(door opens)

468
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:36,118
Mulder, hang on a second.

469
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:34,314
- Judy?
- Scully, what's going on?

470
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:37,269
Mulder, get up here right now.

471
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:44,636
He's upstairs.

472
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:00,949
Judy?

473
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:59,110
(running water)

474
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:04,834
- What the hell are you doin'?
- I'm sorry. I called, but you didn't answer.

475
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:09,350
What's the matter?

476
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:19,036
(gunshots)

477
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,070
- You OK?
- Mm.

478
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:13,676
- Sir?
- Come in.

479
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:20,477
This is our report. You'll see, though,
that several questions remain unanswered.

480
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:25,116
The identity of the man I shot?

481
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:27,675
We ran his face and fingerprints through
every database. There's still no matches.

482
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:34,957
And we're doing a dental-record search,
but that'll probably be a dead end too.

483
00:42:57,240 --> 00:43:00,596
Regarding the other man,
the telephone number we had for him...

484
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:03,996
..has been disconnected
and there's no record of an account.

485
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:08,198
Don't waste your time, Agent Scully.
You won't find him.

486
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:13,838
Just get whatever forensic evidence
you need off the body you have and bury it.

487
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:23,391
- Is there a problem, Agent Mulder?
- There's something else you'll find missing.

488
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:27,559
An explanation for how you knew
to be at the hotel last night.

489
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:32,036
I was hoping you could
fill in that item yourself.

490
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:38,073
- I'm afraid I can't. Not at this point in time.
- Why not?

491
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:43,350
Because whatever
I believe may have happened,...

492
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:49,234
- ..it has no place on an official report.
- Well, then why don't you just tell me?

493
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:51,876
Off the record.

494
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:07,558
If you'll excuse me, l have some catching up
