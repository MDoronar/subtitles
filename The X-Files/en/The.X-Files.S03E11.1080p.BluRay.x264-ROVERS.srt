1
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:05,474
Behold the mighty cockroach.

2
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:14,555
Believed to have originated in the Silurian
period over 350 million years ago,...

3
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:24,997
..they can be found in every part of
the world from the tropics to the Arctic.

4
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:25,672
There exists 4,000 known species,...

5
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:29,031
..and in a year a single female can produce...

6
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:31,873
..over half a million descendants.

7
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:34,796
Radiation doesn't kill them.

8
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:39,311
By evolutionary standards,
they are nearly flawless creatures,...

9
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,796
..but creatures nevertheless.

10
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:49,153
Possessing only a simple nervous system,...

11
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:56,631
..their behaviour is dictated solely
by responses to environmental stimuli.

12
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:03,318
Unlike us, they are incapable of thought,...

13
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:05,072
..of self-illumination.

14
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:11,713
Compared to the roach, we are gods,...

15
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,552
..and must therefore act accordingly.

16
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,389
Is it true if you decapitate them,
they continue to live,...

17
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,632
..eventually dying of starvation?

18
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:19,634
Look, buddy, I just kill 'em.

19
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:26,474
Well, that's why I called you.

20
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:34,595
I thought that nowadays
you froze the insects to death.

21
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:37,399
Freeze 'em? Where's the fun in that?

22
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,117
No, we got a new pesticide
that works like a fungus.

23
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,357
It not only kills the infected roach,
but that roach then spreads the disease...

24
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,957
..to every other roach
it comes into contact with.

25
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,199
Just as long as you get rid of them.

26
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,599
Bugs, you know,...

27
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:43,394
..they drive me crazy.

28
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,709
Why, you arrogant little...

29
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,957
I forgot to tell you, I also found a roach on...

30
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:56,196
(phone rings)

31
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,509
Mulder.

32
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:59,116
(Scully) I've been trying to reach you all day.

33
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:47,390
My apartment complex
was being fumigated

34
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:51,035
so I thought I'd get away for the weekend.

35
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:55,072
- I came up to Massachusetts.
- Visiting your mother?

36
00:03:56,520 --> 00:04:00,115
No. Just sitting and thinking.

37
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:04,870
Accounts of unidentified coloured
lights hovering in the skies...

38
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:05,918
..were reported in this area last night.

39
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:12,638
Look, Scully, I know it's not your inclination,
but did you ever look up into the night sky...

40
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:22,909
..and feel certain that not only
was something up there,...

41
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:27,915
..but it was looking down on you
at that exact same moment,...

42
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:36,439
..and was just as curious about you
as you are about it?

43
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:39,833
The only thing more fortuitous than
the emergence of life on this planet...

44
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:46,116
..is that, through random laws
of biological evolution,...

45
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:51,078
..an intelligence as complex as ours
ever emanated from it.

46
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:56,553
The very idea of intelligent alien life
is not only astronomically improbable,...

47
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:55,913
..but at its most basic level
downright anti-DanNinian.

48
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:00,988
Scully, what are you wearing?

49
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:05,074
I understand what you're saying,
but ljust need to keep looking.

50
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:06,516
Yeah, well, don't look too hard.
You might not like what you find.

51
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:11,355
Isn't that what Dr Zaius said to Charlton
Heston at the end of Planet of the Apes?

52
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,674
And look what happened.

53
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:20,914
- Scully, I gotta go.
- What? Mulder, what's going on?

54
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,670
Mulder.

55
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:21,112
How ya doin'? What are you doin'?

56
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:25,591
- Just sitting, thinking.
- Sittin' and thinkin'.

57
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:37,675
And talkin' on the phone.
Who with, your drug dealer?

58
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,754
Let me see some ID.

59
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:49,190
The Bureau? You on a case?

60
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:45,915
I heard reports of several UFO sightings in
this area last night. Did you see anything?

61
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:54,353
No, sir, not personally.
But we did receive a lot of telephone calls.

62
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:56,954
- Any more calls tonight?
- No, sir.

63
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,548
The FBI keeps tabs on these things?

64
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:03,914
No.

65
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:10,872
I don't like to pry, but why are you
sitting here with your wiper blades on?

66
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:22,038
I was just knocking off
some bugs that landed on my...

67
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:42,998
- Landed on my windshield.
- Cockroaches?

68
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,756
Maybe. Maybe beetles. I don't know.

69
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:57,396
- I'm not really good with bugs.
- (radio) This is Despatch. Come in. Over.

70
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:12,759
- Sorry to disturb you, sir.
- What's the matter?

71
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:03,515
Another roach attack.

72
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,636
(phone rings)

73
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:14,194
- Hello.
- I think you better get up here.

74
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:06,915
What is it?

75
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,639
Cockroaches are mortally attacking people.

76
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:12,953
I'm not gonna ask you if you said what
I think you said. I know it's what you said.

77
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:15,630
I'm with a bug exterminator
whose recently deceased body...

78
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:18,117
..was discovered with cockroaches
crawling all over him.

79
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:22,671
The sheriff says two other bodies were
found in the same condition this afternoon.

80
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,034
Where are you again?

81
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,032
Miller's Grove.
It has a large science constituency.

82
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:33,669
The other incidents involved
a biologist and an astrophysicist.

83
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:37,876
The witness to this case
is an alternative-fuel researcher.

84
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:52,436
These reports are not coming from
yahoos out in the boondocks.

85
00:07:55,560 --> 00:08:01,192
The image of those cockroaches has been
permanently imprinted onto my brain.

86
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:08,074
I see them every time I close my eyes.

87
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:06,108
Try not to close your eyes.

88
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:10,351
How am I gonna sleep?

89
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,711
And where?

90
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:13,157
I'm certainly not spending the night here.

91
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:16,313
Maybe you could get
a motel room or something.

92
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:19,076
- Were there insect bites on the body?
- Insect bites?

93
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,390
No.

94
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:28,069
Cos millions of people
are actually allergic to cockroaches.

95
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:41,036
There have been reported cases of fatal
reactions. It's called anaphylactic shock.

96
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,237
- Anaphylactic shock?
- Such reactions have occurred to...

97
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:51,352
..entomologists or exterminators.

98
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,876
- OK, we'll check that out.
- You still want me to come up?

99
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:57,912
No, no, no. I'm sure you're right.
Thanks, Scully.

100
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,793
- Who was that?
- My drug dealer.

101
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:14,428
Dude, that's some good crap.

102
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,594
Come on, it's your hoot.

103
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:12,553
- I don't know about this, you guys.
- You really ought to, you know. Try it.

104
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:18,399
This stuff takes your mind
and just sort of, you know, expands it.

105
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:20,873
Well, something tells me it's more than my
mind you guys are interested in expanding.

106
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,272
- Well, how about another beer, then?
- OK.

107
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:37,559
I don't know.
I think you're makin' a mistake here.

108
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:41,155
Beer is just, you know... beer.

109
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:46,636
But this stuff, it, like, swings
the doors of perception so wide open,...

110
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:41,510
..you can see
a whole nother world out there.

111
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,870
But it's still like this world, you know.

112
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:52,473
It tweaks your mind and does
this whole altered-state thing to it.

113
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:54,514
And suddenly you see reality as it,
you know,...

114
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,875
..really exists.

115
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:03,350
- Oh, God!
- Dude, what's wrong, man?

116
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,270
Oh, God!

117
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,874
- Roaches!
- Dude, you're freakin', man

118
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:04,030
Roaches! Cockroaches!

119
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,070
Stop it!

120
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,676
(phone rings)

121
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,670
Stay.

122
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,589
Hello?

123
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,398
I take it back. I think you better get up here.

124
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:15,673
- Another roach attack?
- This was no allergic reaction.

125
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,275
Two witnesses claim
they saw the victim screaming

126
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,316
about roaches burrowing into him.

127
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,112
- Are there insects in the body?
- We haven't located any.

128
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:27,474
- But there are wounds all over the body.
- From the cockroaches?

129
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:30,553
Well, the victim did attempt to extract
the insects using a razor blade.

130
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:38,198
We're not sure all the incisions are
self-inflicted, except for the severed artery.

131
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:44,398
- Was there any evidence of drug use?
- Well, he did have a home-made lab setup.

132
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:46,553
I'm not sure what he was producing.

133
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:53,428
Oh, man! It smells like a septic tank.
Will you make sure this gets analysed here?

134
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:59,316
There's a psychotic disorder
associated with some drug abuse,...

135
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:02,551
..where the abuser has delusions
that insects are infesting their epidermis.

136
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:12,792
- It's called Ekbom Syndrome.
- Ekbom Syndrome?

137
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:18,836
The victim cuts himself in an attempt
to extract the imaginary insect.

138
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:25,556
- You still want me to come up?
- No. You're probably right.

139
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,510
- I'm sorry to bother you.
- It's no bother.

140
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:37,230
Bye.

141
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,511
- (barking)
- Hey!

142
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,910
Braindead. Couldn't get anything out of 'em.

143
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,432
How about some urine?

144
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:47,030
For a drug test.

145
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:06,073
- Did you get it?
- Get me a container.

146
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:56,116
- I think I killed it.
- You didn't kill it. You annihilated it.

147
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:03,033
It must have moulted.
It's just empty exoskeleton.

148
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:15,397
At least we have evidence
that cockroaches were here.

149
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:23,396
We've got more than that, Sheriff. I think
that bug's exoskeleton was made of metal.

150
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:44,955
- Nothing more than a skin abrasion.
- Caused by a metallic substance?

151
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:34,835
Why don't we wait until the analysis
of the compound is finished...

152
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:41,878
..before jumping to any conclusions?

153
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:52,072
Agent Mulder, as a doctor, I always find it
best to be completely honest and open...

154
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:58,476
..with my patients,
no matter how unpleasant the information.

155
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:01,148
What do you need to tell me?

156
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,959
No, I need you to tell me something.

157
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:07,154
What the hell is going on here?

158
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:10,069
- Are we in any danger?
- I don't know.

159
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:17,875
- Well, should I evacuate my family?
- I wouldn't know.

160
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:22,832
They're waiting for you
to examine the boy's body.

161
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:35,111
Yeah, soon as I take a little break.

162
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:07,753
After talking with Agent Mulder here,
I suddenly feel slightly constipated.

163
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,359
What's his problem?

164
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:13,236
He's upset that I don't know
what's going on here.

165
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,310
So what the hell is goin' on here?

166
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:53,429
Just because I work for the government
doesn't mean I'm an expert on cockroaches.

167
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:29,358
You're saying you don't know anything
about the government's experiments here?

168
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:43,795
- Experiments?
- A Department of Agriculture agent...

169
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:47,913
..sets up base on
a couple of acres across town.

170
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,754
Nobody knows exactly what's
goin' on out there. It's top-secret.

171
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:55,877
- Very hush-hush.
- What are you suggesting?

172
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:02,069
Killer bees were a genetic
experiment gone awry.

173
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:05,959
Let loose on an unsuspecting populace.

174
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:10,635
Who's to say the government hasn't created
a new breed of killer cockroaches?

175
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:16,836
You might wanna keep that theory to
yourself, Sheriff. No need to create a panic.

176
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:18,714
(man) Oh! Oh, my God! Help!
Somebody help me!

177
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,993
- What the hell happened?
- Cockroaches.

178
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:24,754
- He was covered in cockroaches.
- I don't see any roaches.

179
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:31,232
Well, when I went out to look for help
and I came back, they'd disappeared.

180
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:47,192
Gently.

181
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,516
Gently.

182
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,034
It doesn't appear odd in any...

183
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:46,757
Next time let me handle the roaches.

184
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,950
(phone rings)

185
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,190
Who died now?

186
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:54,598
The medical examiner. His body was found
next to a toilet covered with roaches.

187
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:02,080
- I really think you should come.
- A toilet?

188
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:05,677
Check his eyes. Is one of them bloodshot,
with a dilated pupil?

189
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:11,875
- Well, yeah.
- It was probably a brain aneurysm.

190
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:13,909
Brain aneurysm?

191
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:23,909
Straining too forcefully is very common
causation for bursting a brain aneurysm.

192
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,595
- How do you explain the roaches, though?
- Did you catch any?

193
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:03,591
- Almost.
- I don't know what to tell you, Mulder.

194
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:08,834
I just hope you're not implying you've come
across an infestation of killer cockroaches.

195
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:13,910
(phone rings)

196
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:19,594
- Mulder.
- Mulder, I've been doing some research.

197
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:58,034
In the '80s there was a cockroach species
previously only found in Asia.

198
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:06,510
Since then it's appeared in Florida. They've
now established themselves in this country.

199
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:21,911
- Do they attack people?
- No, but they're different than our breeds.

200
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,873
They fly long distances
and are attracted to light.

201
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:26,195
- Do they attack people?
- I'm suggesting that what's happening...

202
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:33,232
..might be the introduction of
a new species of cockroach,

203
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,438
one that is attracted to people.

204
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:35,273
That all makes perfect sense.
I don't like it at all.

205
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:38,592
Did you know that
the Federal Government has been...

206
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,870
..conducting secret experiments here?

207
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:48,557
You're not thinking of trespassing
onto government property?

208
00:18:55,040 --> 00:19:00,478
- I know you've done it in the past, but I...
- It's too late. I'm already inside.

209
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:09,434
- Well, what's going on? What do you see?
- I'm in a house.

210
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:07,559
It's apparently empty.

211
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:11,633
- What does the place look like?
- It's a typical two-storey suburban house.

212
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:18,115
Nice big living room,
sparsely furnished, nice carpets, fireplace.

213
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:21,916
Nice kitchen, modern appliances.

214
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:28,676
- Moving walls.
- Moving walls?

215
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:26,511
Yeah.

216
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,676
They're rippling.

217
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:33,713
- Oh! Cockroaches!
- What?!

218
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:29,233
Cockroaches. They're everywhere!

219
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,429
Ugh! I'm surrounded.

220
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:37,910
- You've got to get out of there right now.
- No!

221
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:44,592
- Are you all right? What happened?
- Flashlight went out.

222
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,880
Mulder, what's going on?

223
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:32,795
Gotta go.

224
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,950
Mulder! Mulder!

225
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:58,510
May I ask why you're trespassing
on government property?

226
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:23,152
- I'm a federal agent.
-So am I

227
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,113
Agent Mulder, FBI.

228
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:54,399
Dr Berenbaum, USDA,
Agricultural Research Service.

229
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:05,753
Dr Berenbaum,
I'm gonna have to ask you a few questions.

230
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:10,594
For instance?

231
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:14,275
What's a woman like you
doing in a place like this?

232
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:18,393
By studying how insects respond
to changes in light, temperature,...

233
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:25,791
..air currents, food availability, we can
determine the best ways to eradicate them.

234
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:39,590
Why all the secrecy about your research?
You got the good townspeople suspicious.

235
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:43,234
You expect us to advertise that
we've intentionally infested a house...

236
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:49,030
..with thousands of cockroaches?

237
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:55,479
But those cockroaches,
are they a normal species?

238
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:05,989
They're a common one.

239
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:11,558
Have you ever come across a type of
cockroach that is attracted to people?

240
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,919
Most cockroaches have been known
to wash themselves

241
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:23,151
after being touched by humans.

242
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:27,639
So you've never seen an instance where
a cockroach attacks a human being?

243
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:39,759
There have been cases where cockroaches
crawled into a person's ear, nose...

244
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:44,556
Nose?

245
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:48,790
What is that there?

246
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:44,274
It's just a pet project of mine.

247
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:48,398
Since an insect's exoskeleton
is a dielectric...

248
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:51,992
..surrounding the conductive
medium of its body fluid,...

249
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:55,677
..when introduced into an electrical field,

250
00:25:55,800 --> 00:26:00,157
the brush discharge results
in a coloured flare.

251
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:06,235
What is that supposed to prove?

252
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:08,832
Well, it's my theory that UFOs
are actually insect swarms.

253
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:16,118
I don't know if you know anything about
UFOs, but all the characteristics of...

254
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:17,113
..a typical sighting are shared
with nocturnal insects

255
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:19,235
swarming through an electrical field.

256
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:22,033
The sudden appearance of a coloured,
glowing light hovering in the night sky.

257
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:32,676
Moving in a non-mechanical manner,
possibly humming.

258
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:38,431
Creating interference with
radio and television signals,...

259
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:41,194
..then suddenly disappearing.

260
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:45,434
As... nocturnal insect swarms.

261
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:48,188
It's... it's fascinating.

262
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:46,952
Everything about insects is fascinating.

263
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:47,908
They are truly remarkable creatures.

264
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,719
So beautiful and so honest.

265
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:52,997
Honest?

266
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:55,073
Eat, sleep, defecate, procreate.
That's all they do.

267
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:58,311
That's all we do,
but at least insects don't kid themselves

268
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:16,677
that it's anything more than that.

269
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:19,672
Does my scientific detachment disturb you?

270
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:23,908
No. No, actually, I find it quite refreshing.

271
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,710
(phone rings)

272
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:27,629
Not now. You know, um...

273
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:32,913
..I have always found insects
to be very interesting.

274
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,674
Really?

275
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:44,277
This is the fifth report of a deceased body
found amongst a horde of cockroaches,...

276
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:37,034
..but police are not confirming - yet -

277
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:39,917
that the insects have anything to do
with the fatalities.

278
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:43,915
Police have denied that these deaths
were the result of an outbreak...

279
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:46,232
..of the Ebola virus somehow being
spread by infected cockroaches.

280
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:51,590
For now these incidents remain
under local jurisdiction, . ..

281
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:55,917
..but a nurse here did confirm
that an FBI agent is on the case.

282
00:27:56,560 --> 00:28:00,235
Police are asking that if you see
any cockroaches, don 't panic.

283
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:03,195
Simply notify the local authorities
and evacuate the area immediately.

284
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:07,876
Reporting live,
this is Sky Lathan for Channel 3 News.

285
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:10,395
Then suddenly there was this terrible crash.
You know, you could have been killed.

286
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:46,119
- (phone rings)
- Mulder, are you OK?

287
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:16,277
- I can't sleep.
- What happened at the USDA site?

288
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:20,234
They're conducting legitimate experiments.
I met an entomologist, a Dr Berenbaum,...

289
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:35,033
..who agrees with your theory of
an accidental importation of a new species.

290
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:35,476
Did he tell you how to catch 'em?

291
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:39,473
No, but she did tell me everything else
there is to know about insects.

292
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,189
She?

293
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:01,994
Yeah. Did you know the ancient Egyptians
worshipped the scarab beetle...

294
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:07,319
..and maybe erected the pyramids to honour
them, which may be symbolic dung heaps?

295
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:15,912
Did you know the inventor of the
flush toilet was named Thomas Crapper?

296
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:16,953
- Bambi has a theory I've never come across.
- Who?

297
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:30,753
- Dr Berenbaum. Anyway, her theory is...
- Her name is Bambi?

298
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,560
Yeah, both her parents were naturalists.

299
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:46,917
Her theory is that UFOs are nocturnal insect
swarms passing through electrical airfields.

300
00:29:56,200 --> 00:30:00,557
- Her name is Bambi?
- Scully, can I confess something to you?

301
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:37,154
- Yeah, sure, OK.
- I hate insects.

302
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:47,073
You know, lots of people are
afraid of insects, Mulder. It's just...

303
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:23,478
- It's a natural instinct of...
- No, no, no, I'm not afraid of them.

304
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,948
I hate them.

305
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:28,953
One day back when I was a kid,
I was climbing this tree...

306
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,639
..when I noticed this leaf
walking towards me.

307
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:37,235
- It took me for ever to realise it was no leaf.
- A praying mantis?

308
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:41,070
Yeah, I had a praying-mantis epiphany,
and as a result I screamed.

309
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:53,790
Not a girlie scream, but the scream
of someone being confronted...

310
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:58,039
..by some before-unknown monster that had
no right existing on the same planet.

311
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:14,838
Did you ever notice how a praying mantis's
head resembles an alien's head?

312
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:22,153
The mysteries of the natural world
were revealed.

313
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:25,435
Instead of being astounded, I was...

314
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:25,588
..repulsed.

315
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:28,558
Mulder, are you sure
it wasn't a girlie scream?

316
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,231
- (man screams)
- What was that?

317
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:33,796
- I gotta go.
- Mul... No...

318
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:41,190
- Did you hear that too?
- It came from over here.

319
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,710
What the hell's goin' on?

320
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,870
Hello?

321
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:28,394
Is everything all right in there?

322
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:35,950
(screams)

323
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:29,996
(phone rings)

324
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:37,115
- What happened this time?
- One of the motel guests died.

325
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:38,034
Mulder, I'm coming up there right now.

326
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:41,314
Scully, I think this man died simply from
a reaction to the cockroaches.

327
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:46,672
Two cases of anaphylactic shock
in the same day in the same town

328
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:47,391
is highly improbable.

329
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:50,916
I'm saying that this man
simply had a heart attack.

330
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:54,636
Word about the cockroach infestation
and the deaths related to it has gotten out.

331
00:33:57,920 --> 00:34:02,038
I think this man simply saw some
cockroaches and scared himself to death.

332
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:06,156
Regardless, something strange
is definitely going on up there.

333
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:07,990
Maybe not.
All your conjectures have proved correct.

334
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:12,756
The exterminator did die
from anaphylactic shock.

335
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:15,274
The boy did die from self-inflicted wounds...

336
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:16,713
..and was getting high off methane fumes
derived from burning manure.

337
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:20,599
The medical examiner
did die from a brain aneurysm.

338
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:21,592
I still haven't been able
to explain the cockroaches.

339
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:24,956
Or the fact that their
exoskeletons are made of metal.

340
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:35,511
Metal? What are you talking about?

341
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:47,998
Mulder?

342
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:55,871
- Mulder, I'm coming up there.
- Whatever.

343
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:20,469
- Can you tell what kind of cockroach it is?
- I should be able to.

344
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:18,959
The abdomen's still attached and we
differentiate species by their genitalia.

345
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:24,548
- Oh, my God.
- Is it abnormal?

346
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:29,031
I'll say. He's hung like
a club-tailed dragonfly! Excuse me.

347
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:28,275
- Does it still look unusual?
- Well, yes. For an insect genitalia.

348
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,789
But maybe not for a microprocessor.

349
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:37,952
You're implying that
this insect is mechanical?

350
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:39,430
What am I supposed to be looking at here?

351
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:40,232
Have you ever seen
anything like this before?

352
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:45,639
Only in science journals. I've read about
an artificial-intelligence researcher...

353
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:55,114
..who designs robots that resemble
and behave like insects.

354
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:55,035
I've never seen them,
but I've often thought of visiting his lab.

355
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:01,954
He works out of this town?

356
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:49,068
- Dr Ivanov?
- Why are you scaring my robots?

357
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:20,029
For decades my colleagues
in artificial intelligence...

358
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:30,149
..have attempted to create
an autonomous robot.

359
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:38,789
By struggling to give their machines
a humanlike brain, they have failed.

360
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:41,550
A human brain is too complex.

361
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:49,389
Too computational. It thinks too much.

362
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:54,032
But insects merely react.

363
00:36:57,840 --> 00:37:01,992
I've used insects as my model,
not just in design,...

364
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:05,634
..but by giving them the simplest
of computer programs:

365
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:09,548
"Go to the object."
"Go away from moving object."

366
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:13,030
Governed only by sensors
and reflex responses,...

367
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:21,158
..they take on the behaviour
of intelligent living beings.

368
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:20,319
So this is programmed
to head towards any object...

369
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:25,559
..moving within the field of its sensors?

370
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:25,071
No.

371
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:27,276
Then why is it following me?

372
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:32,119
It likes you.

373
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:32,076
Your contract is with NASA?

374
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:36,073
The goal is to transport a fleet
of robots to another planet...

375
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:40,595
..and allow them to navigate
the terrain with more intricacy...

376
00:37:57,600 --> 00:38:00,910
..than any space probe has done before.

377
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:08,837
And it sounds slightly fantastic,
but the only obstacle I can foresee...

378
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:16,119
..is devising a renewable energy source.

379
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:22,797
In any case,
this is the future of space exploration.

380
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:31,238
It does not include living entities.

381
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:42,554
I'm just speculating,
but if extraterrestrial life forms do exist...

382
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:50,395
No need for speculation. I believe they do.

383
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:56,879
If they're technologically advanced,
and if your ideas about the future...

384
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:04,159
- ..of space exploration are correct...
- The interplanetary explorers...

385
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:39,315
..of alien civilisations will likely
be mechanical in nature. Yes.

386
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:08,237
Anyone who thinks alien visitation
will come not in the form of robots...

387
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:44,158
..but of living beings
with big eyes and grey skin...

388
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:06,916
..has been brainwashed
by too much science fiction.

389
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:21,953
- Can you identify this?
- I'm not really good with bugs.

390
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:17,155
- A cricket's leg?
- Try it under the microscope.

391
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:42,270
Are you all right, Dr Ivanov?

392
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:24,156
Can you identify that?

393
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:33,396
Sir?

394
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:41,157
It's... beyond my comprehension.

395
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:54,550
Hey, kid! Move it!

396
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:58,030
Let go,buddy!

397
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:10,790
Get back in the car!

398
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:02,629
- (man) Hey, what are you, crazy?
- (woman) Hey, you idiot! You hit me!

399
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:03,870
Excuse me. Do you sell road maps?
Could you tell me where they are?

400
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:15,393
- Come on. Hurry up.
- What's going on here?

401
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:17,952
Haven't you heard about the roaches?

402
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:21,991
They're devouring people.
We're getting outta here.

403
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:35,357
- Have you seen any yourself?
- No, but they're everywhere.

404
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:38,351
Roaches aren't attacking people. They're
spreading the Ebola virus. Keep the change.

405
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:48,600
We're all gonna be bleeding
from our nipples.

406
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:58,476
All right. Listen up! I'm Agent Dana Scully
from the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

407
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:05,076
I am assuring you that
you are not in any danger.

408
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:09,111
Everything is gonna be OK if you just
calm down and start acting rationally.

409
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:18,158
Now where the hell are those road maps?

410
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:24,188
Hey! This last can is mine!

411
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:21,800
Roaches!

412
00:43:57,200 --> 00:44:03,469
Well, Doctor, I... I appreciate you taking
the time to... answer my questions.

413
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:34,476
Yeah.

414
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:06,989
Greetings from planet Earth.

415
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:32,638
Well, it's a cockroach all right.

416
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:38,432
It's not like the leg segment
you had me examine earlier.

417
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:43,234
- It's just a typical cockroach.
- Even the...

418
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:49,231
Yes, even the genitalia's normal.

419
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:58,239
Cockroaches are common
in this area this time of year.

420
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:26,110
It's one of the reasons
I set up my study here.

421
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:48,316
(phone rings)

422
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:53,519
- Mulder.
- Mulder, this town is insane.

423
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:57,599
- Where are you?
- In a convenience store on the outskirts of...

424
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:00,038
..civilisation.

425
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:03,197
Look, I think I may have a lead.
Remember Dr Eckerle,...

426
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:07,478
..the alternative-fuel researcher
that witnessed the exterminator's death?

427
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:10,711
Well, the fuel that he's researching
is methane gas.

428
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:13,872
- Methane derived from manure.
- Manure?

429
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:18,710
He has an import licence to bring in animal
dung samples from outside the country.

430
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:22,549
Now, maybe you can confirm this
with your Dr Bambi,...

431
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:25,638
..but I think the cockroaches
are dung eaters,...

432
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:28,632
..and, if so, some of them
may have been shipped accidentally

433
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:30,233
in some of the samples.

434
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:35,195
This fuel research facility could be
ground zero for the infestation.

435
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:40,474
If an alien civilisation were technologically
advanced enough to build and send...

436
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:44,235
..artificially intelligent
robotic probes to space,...

437
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:46,237
..might they not have been able to perfect

438
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:48,914
the extraction of methane fuel
from manure,...

439
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:55,075
..a replenishing energy source on a planet
filled with dung-producing creatures?

440
00:45:58,080 --> 00:46:03,871
- I think you've been in this town too long.
- Where's the research facility located?

441
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:12,752
Bambi, you better wait here
until I make sure it's safe.

442
00:46:12,920 --> 00:46:16,276
Be careful. We don't know what
these cockroaches are capable of.

443
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:18,038
If they're even cockroaches.

444
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:21,271
I'm more worried about the human element.

445
00:47:16,520 --> 00:47:18,590
(gunshot)

446
00:47:20,840 --> 00:47:22,956
Dr Eckerle?

447
00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:29,116
They're after me.
First at my house. Then at the motel.

448
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:31,668
And then I came here to get away.

449
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:36,672
But... they're following me.

450
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:39,513
You're not in any danger.
They won't harm you.

451
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:44,355
- I've seen them kill two men.
- They weren't responsible for those deaths.

452
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:46,192
But they might be responsible for ours

453
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:49,795
if you fire your gun
in a plant full of methane gas.

454
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:51,996
Don't you understand?

455
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:56,189
The bugs,...

456
00:47:56,280 --> 00:47:58,794
..they drive me crazy.

457
00:48:04,360 --> 00:48:06,635
Let me guess. Bambi.

458
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:10,872
Fox told me to wait out here
while he checked inside first.

459
00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:15,080
Should I come along with you?

460
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:17,071
No.

461
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:20,072
This is no place for an entomologist.

462
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:25,310
Why are these roaches
making those weird noises?

463
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:30,918
In Madagascar the roaches hiss by blowing
air through holes in their upper thorax.

464
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:33,395
Really?

465
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:36,830
- How do you know so much about them?
- I don't.

466
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:39,718
That's why we shouldn't kill these
but capture them for further study.

467
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:42,439
Put the gun down.

468
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:49,749
- Have I lost my mind?
- No.

469
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:54,432
You've had a very stressful day
that's affected your ability to think clearly.

470
00:48:54,520 --> 00:48:56,715
Your judgment is a little clouded right now.

471
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:57,949
It is?

472
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:05,797
Then how do I know
that you're not a cockroach?

473
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:10,436
Mulder?

474
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:15,270
Mulder!

475
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:26,035
I assure you, Dr Eckerle,
I'm just as human as you are. If not more so.

476
00:49:26,120 --> 00:49:28,475
(phone rings)

477
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:32,628
You are one of them!

478
00:49:40,080 --> 00:49:43,595
- Mulder!
- Get out! This whole place could blow!

479
00:49:45,120 --> 00:49:47,156
Get down!

480
00:50:04,680 --> 00:50:06,750
Crap.

481
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:15,278
It's like a crematorium. I don't think
we're gonna locate the doctor's remains.

482
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:19,273
- Or anything else for that matter.
- It's not as bad as some of the other fires.

483
00:50:19,360 --> 00:50:22,193
- There were others?
- Four, to be exact.

484
00:50:22,280 --> 00:50:26,671
Plus 18 automobile accidents, 13 assault
and batteries, two stores were looted.

485
00:50:26,840 --> 00:50:30,958
36 injuries all total,
half of 'em from insecticide poisoning.

486
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:34,032
But we didn't receive reports
on cockroaches

487
00:50:34,120 --> 00:50:35,792
or otherwise for the last couple of hours.

488
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:39,555
Maybe this town's
finally come to its senses.

489
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:43,468
You two oughta go home and get some rest.
You look pooped.

490
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:47,191
Agent Mulder!

491
00:50:47,360 --> 00:50:49,828
They told me I could locate you here.

492
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:55,795
Those segments you showed me earlier -
may I examine them again?

493
00:50:55,880 --> 00:50:58,872
Well, they're completely desiccated.

494
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:01,793
Just like the moulted exoskeleton.

495
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:05,708
Many insects don't develop wings
until their last moulting stage.

496
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:09,077
Perhaps these things had their final moult...

497
00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:12,152
..and have flown off back
to wherever they originated.

498
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:18,156
- Yeah, that would explain everything(!)
- May I borrow this for further study?

499
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:22,313
I've already had a similar sample analysed.
It's nothing but common metals.

500
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:26,399
- What do you hope to find from it?
- His destiny.

501
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:33,070
Isn't that what Dr Zaius said to Zira
at the end of the Planet of the Apes?

502
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:36,910
- It's one of my favourite movies.
- Mine too.

503
00:51:37,080 --> 00:51:39,514
I love science fiction.

504
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:42,433
I'm also fascinated by your research.

505
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:45,120
Have you considered
programming your robots...

506
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:48,431
..to mimic behaviour
of social insects like ants or bees?

507
00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:50,596
As a matter of fact, I have.

508
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:52,796
You know, I read...

509
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:03,590
Smart is sexy.

510
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:08,396
Think of it this way.
By the time there's another invasion...

511
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:11,950
..of artificially intelligent,
dung-eating robotic probes,...

512
00:52:12,040 --> 00:52:15,953
..maybe their Uberchildren will have
devised a way to save our planet.

513
00:52:16,080 --> 00:52:19,470
You know,
I never thought I'd say this to you, Scully,...

514
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:21,875
..but you smell bad.

515
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:29,840
Our cerebral cortex
is the greatest achievement...

516
00:52:29,960 --> 00:52:33,635
..of the evolutionary processes. Big deal.

517
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:37,230
While allowing us intellect
and self-consciousness,...

518
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:41,233
..it is all too often overruled
by our inner instinctive brain:

519
00:52:41,320 --> 00:52:46,519
the one that tells us to react, not reflect,
to run rather than ruminate.

520
00:52:52,520 --> 00:52:55,592
Maybe we have gone as far as
we can go, and the next advance,...

521
00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:59,992
..whatever that may be, will be made
by beings we create using our own tech...

522
00:53:00,120 --> 00:53:02,031
(beep)

523
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:04,196
- ..tech...
- (beep)

524
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:11,193
..technology. Life forms we can
design and program not to be...

525
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:15,990
..ultimately governed and
constricted by the rules of survival.

526
00:53:18,120 --> 00:53:21,430
Perhaps that step has already
been achieved on another planet...

527
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:24,717
..by organisms that had
a billion years' head start on us.

528
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:28,634
If these beings ever visited us,
would we recognise what we were seeing?

529
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:31,712
And would they react
in anything but horror...

530
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:36,032
..at seeing such mindless,
primitive, hideous creatures?

531
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:20,196

532
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:34,918
(child) I made this!
